# StudentRecordManagement

A **simple command-line Java application** that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage student records using an 'ArrayList'. The system allows adding, viewing, updating, and deleting student data like ID, name, and marks.

## Objective

Build a CLI-based system to manage student records:
- Add a new student (ID, Name, Marks)
- View all students
- Update student details by ID
- Delete student by ID

## Tools Used

-  **Java (JDK 24)**
-  **Eclipse IDE**
-  **Git & GitHub** 

## How to Run the Project in Eclipse

1. **Open Eclipse IDE**
2. **Create a New Java Project**:  
   File → New → Java Project → Name it as 'Task2'
3. **Create a New Class**:  
   Right-click 'src' → New → Class → Name it 'StudentCRUDSystem'  
   Check the box:'public static void main(String[] args)'
4. **Write the Code**:  
   in StudentCRUDSystem.java'
5. **Run the Program**:  
   Right-click the file → 'Run As' → 'Java Application'
6. **Use the Eclipse Terminal** to interact with the menu.

## Key Concepts Practiced

- Java Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation using Getters and Setters
- 'ArrayList' usage for dynamic storage
- Menu-based CLI design using loops and conditionals
- Input handling using 'Scanner'
- Real-world simulation of a mini student database
